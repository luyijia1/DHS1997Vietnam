# DHS1997Vietnam

This repository is going to be the analysis of Table 10.2 (AIDS Prevention) in the Final Report of Vietnam Demographic and Health Survey (1997).

It is organized as follows:

In the file of inputs, the original final report in PDF version was downloaded from DHS program.
In the file of scripts, the simulation, gathering, as well as the cleaning and preparation of data were completed. 
In the file of outputs/data, the table 10.2 (AIDS Prevention) in the original final report (PDF) was converted into six sections in CSV version, named as "Section1_Age", "Section2_Marital_Status", et al.. Then, they were converted vertically to show a more obvious relationship between background characteristics and ways to avoid AIDS. The modified CSVs were named as "Modified_Section1_Age", "Modified_Section2_Marital_Status", et al..


The rmarkdown and pdf version of the analysis are also attached in the file of outputs/data.
