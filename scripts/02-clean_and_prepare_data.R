# Since there are six background characteristics discussed, they will be separated into six sections. 
# Pre-requisites:
# -- Have to check the previous procedures about downloading the final report in PDF version, gathering and converting the dataset.
# -- Check ‘scripts/01-gather_data.R’
# Procedures below shows the cleaning and preparing for Section1_Age, indicating women's knowledge of ways to avoid AIDS across different age groups. 
# After parcing, there were errors in the data in row 6 which is the Age group of "40-49". 
# The data were reviewed and corrected. The dataset is converted into CSV version which can be checked in 'outputs/data/Section1_Age.csv'
